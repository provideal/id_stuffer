h1. IdStuffer

A way to efficiently store ids (i.e., possibly sequential numbers > 0), well suited for params-ecoding.

Note that the ids will be sorted and uniqued.

h2. Examples

<pre>
> require 'id_stuffer'
=> true
> l = IdStuffer.stuff [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,15,16,17]
=> "IdS1ulxye8j3x"
> IdStuffer.unstuff(l)
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17]
</pre>

It's efficiency depends on the ocurrence of 'runs':

<pre>
> IdStuffer.stuff [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
=> "IdS1eh"
> IdStuffer.stuff [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,15,16,17]
=> "IdS1ulxye8j3x"
> IdStuffer.stuff [1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,26,29,31,35]
=> "IdS14iltvlqc3t1ifhh1o8wnmf"
</pre>
